## Development and Future Plans

Beatstreet has been a labor of love, developed by a single developer over the course of more than one month. The frontend alone required countless hours of work, with many bugs and challenges along the way. However, the end result is a beautiful and intuitive website that offers free music streaming to users all over the world.

As a beginner, developing Beatstreet has been an incredibly challenging experience, but also been incredibly rewarding. Over the course of this project, I have gained valuable experience working with technologies such as MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, as well as improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue to develop Beatstreet and add new features and functionality to the website. Some of the features I am considering for the future include:

- Social features: enabling users to follow each other and share playlists with friends
  Developing these features will require a significant amount of work, but I am excited about the challenge and am committed to continuing to improve and refine Beatstreet for the benefit of its users.

- Lyrics Integration: Integrating a lyrics API to show the lyrics of the current playing song on the screen

- User Feedback: Allowing users to provide feedback about the website and suggest new features they would like to see in the future. This feedback can be used to improve the website and make it more user-friendly.

- Social Sharing: Allowing users to share their favorite songs, playlists and artists on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Developing these features will require a significant amount of work, but I am excited about the challenge and am committed to continuing to improve and refine Beatstreet for the benefit of its users.

Thank you for your support, and stay tuned for more updates and improvements in the future!
